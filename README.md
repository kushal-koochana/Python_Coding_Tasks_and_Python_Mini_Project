## Requirements

* **Python:** 3.8 or later (Python 3.6+ may also work, but Python 3.8+ is recommended)
* **Recommended IDE:** PyCharm (any Python-compatible IDE or text editor can be used)

---

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Python_Coding_Tasks_and_Python_Mini_Project
```

---

## Usage

Run the Codewars practice file:

```bash
python Codewars_Practice.py
```

Run the Mini Bingo Game:

```bash
python Mini_Bingo_Game.py
```

> **Note:** Most Codewars solutions are designed to be called individually rather than executed directly. All completed kata solutions have passed the official Codewars test suite.

# Overview

This repository serves as a personal Python practice project aimed at improving:

* Problem-solving ability
* Python programming fundamentals
* Clean and modular coding practices
* Object-oriented programming
* Algorithmic thinking

It combines coding challenge solutions from Codewars with a small interactive terminal game to demonstrate practical Python development.

# Features

## 🧩 Codewars Practice (`Codewars_Practice.py`)

A growing collection of Python solutions covering a wide range of programming concepts.

### 🔹 8 kyu – Python Fundamentals

Includes exercises involving:

* String manipulation
* Basic arithmetic
* Conditional logic
* Dictionary usage
* Simple classes (e.g. `Hero`, `User`)
* Beginner algorithms

---

### 🔹 7 kyu – Intermediate Programming

Includes topics such as:

* Number and digit manipulation
* Array and list transformations
* String parsing
* Mathematical algorithms
* Binary conversion
* Data validation and filtering

---

### 🔹 6 kyu – Advanced Problem Solving

Includes more complex programming challenges involving:

* Pattern matching and encoding (`duplicate_encode`)
* Queue simulations
* Sorting and reconstruction algorithms
* Binary parity checking
* Chess board validation and FEN conversion
* Custom data structures (e.g. `WordDictionary`, `Potion`, `Robot`)

---

## 🎮 Mini Bingo Game (`Mini_Bingo_Game.py`)

A terminal-based interactive Bingo simulation where users can customise the game before playing.

### Features

* Choose the bingo card size
* Select the range of possible numbers
* Choose how many numbers will be drawn
* Automatically generate a random bingo card
* Draw numbers sequentially
* Detect matching numbers in real time
* Display current progress throughout the game
* End the game when:

  * Every number has been matched (**BINGO!**), or
  * All draws have been completed

---

## Example Gameplay

```text
Your Bingo Card:
[3, 18, 7, 22]

Number drawn: 7
✓ Match found!

Current score: 1 / 4
```

---

## Notes

* This repository is intended for learning and practice rather than production use.
* Solutions prioritise readability and understanding while exploring different approaches to solving problems.
* New Codewars kata are added as programming skills continue to develop.
* The project demonstrates progressive learning through increasingly challenging exercises.

---

## Future Improvements

Potential future additions include:

* Solving higher-difficulty Codewars kata (5 kyu and above)
* Splitting Codewars solutions into multiple modules
* Adding unit tests using `pytest`
* Improving documentation and inline comments
* Adding type hints throughout the project
* Creating additional Python mini projects
